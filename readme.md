# What is this
This readme.md file is under construction... 🔨

You can follow the progress from my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/YvU72F2l/2d-game).
I try to update things there. Im still learning that platform so nothing fancy yet... Please help...

I am using my own .jar libraries.
I am trying to create a 2D game using java.
I am not very good at coming up with ideas about video games, **so I asked chat gpt** the following question: “Can you generate me an idea for a video game that is about foraging and collecting mushrooms”
...
As you can see, im not very good with ideas... Mushrooms and foraging... what was i thinking...

But the AI gave me a response. A very good might i add...

**Response:**

> Title: "Fungal Harvesters"
> 
> Concept: "Fungal Harvesters" is a vibrant and immersive video game that takes players on an enchanting journey through diverse and magical landscapes filled with a wide variety of mushrooms. The game combines elements of exploration, foraging, and strategy to create a unique gaming experience.
>
> Gameplay:
>
> **Exploration and Discovery:** Players navigate through lush, procedurally generated environments, each with its own distinct ecosystem and mushroom varieties. From mystical forests to hidden caves, the world is full of surprises waiting to be discovered.
> **Foraging Challenges:** The primary objective is to forage and collect different types of mushrooms. However, not all mushrooms are easy to find, and some may only bloom under specific conditions or during certain times of the day. Players must use their observational skills and knowledge of each mushroom's habitat to locate them.
> **Crafting and Alchemy:** Collected mushrooms can be used in a crafting system to create potions, elixirs, and other magical items. Experimenting with different combinations of mushrooms yields unique effects, encouraging players to strategize and optimize their resources.
> **Wildlife Interaction:** The world is teeming with magical creatures, some friendly and others not so much. Players must navigate encounters with these creatures, learning to avoid or interact with them strategically. Some creatures may even assist in mushroom collection or provide hints about rare mushroom locations.
> **Dynamic Weather System:** Weather conditions play a crucial role in the game. Certain mushrooms may only appear during specific weather patterns, and players must adapt their foraging strategies accordingly. A dynamic day-night cycle and seasonal changes add an extra layer of depth to the gameplay.
> **Community Building:** As players progress, they can establish a camp or village where fellow mushroom enthusiasts gather. Trading mushrooms, sharing insights, and collaborating on challenging quests contribute to the growth of the community.
> **Quests and Mysteries:** The game features a rich storyline with quests and mysteries tied to the magical properties of certain rare mushrooms. Unraveling these mysteries unlocks new areas, abilities, and advancements in the game.
> **Art Style:** The game adopts a vibrant and whimsical art style, with lush environments, colorful mushrooms, and magical effects. The atmosphere is both calming and mysterious, creating an immersive world that players will enjoy exploring.
> 
> Overall, "Fungal Harvesters" offers a relaxing yet engaging experience for players who appreciate the beauty of nature, the thrill of exploration, and the satisfaction of strategic foraging.

So a game about a mystical world...

But i don't think thats enough. I don't think game can be just about collecting mushrooms.
What is the goal of the game?
Why does the player collect mushrooms?
Is collecting mushrooms the core mechanic of the game?

## Improving idea
Maybe the game has quests. Procedually generated levels. 1 level can be big as hell, like 1000 x 1000. That one level can have multiple biomes.
Different biomes have different mushrooms, enemies, dangers...
I don't want to make a fighting game. I want to make a game where user has to hide, lure, guide and advance without hurting enemies.
Enemies should be animals, fantasy animals, or something like that. They have different behaviours. They are not evil.
Maybe some mushrooms are only visible or present when some specific animal is near it.
Some animals are territorial and they defend the area so player must somehow lure them away or try to sneak in and steal the food?
Stealing is bad 😢
Maybe player can make a trade? some mushrooms are needed to get others?

Player spawns Where?
There is a place where player returns after every run in randomly generated world.
How is the world different? What is the reason for it? Fantasy creatures -> magical portal? 🧙‍♂️ 🌀
Does it need a reason?

Player can collect stuff from the world and use them later?
