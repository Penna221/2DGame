You can follow the progress from my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/YvU72F2l/2d-game).
I try to update things there. Im still learning that platform so nothing fancy yet... Please help...

I am using my own .jar libraries.
I am trying to create a 2D game using java.
I am not very good at coming up with ideas about video games, **so I asked chat gpt** the following question: “Can you generate me an idea for a video game that is about foraging and collecting mushrooms”
...
As you can see, im not very good with ideas... Mushrooms and foraging... what was i thinking...

But the AI gave me a response. A very good might i add...

**Response:**

>
> Gameplay:
>
> **Exploration and Discovery:** Players navigate through lush, procedurally generated environments, each with its own distinct ecosystem and mushroom varieties. From mystical forests to hidden caves, the world is full of surprises waiting to be discovered.
> **Foraging Challenges:** The primary objective is to forage and collect different types of mushrooms. However, not all mushrooms are easy to find, and some may only bloom under specific conditions or during certain times of the day. Players must use their observational skills and knowledge of each mushroom's habitat to locate them.
> **Crafting and Alchemy:** Collected mushrooms can be used in a crafting system to create potions, elixirs, and other magical items. Experimenting with different combinations of mushrooms yields unique effects, encouraging players to strategize and optimize their resources.
> **Wildlife Interaction:** The world is teeming with magical creatures, some friendly and others not so much. Players must navigate encounters with these creatures, learning to avoid or interact with them strategically. Some creatures may even assist in mushroom collection or provide hints about rare mushroom locations.
> **Dynamic Weather System:** Weather conditions play a crucial role in the game. Certain mushrooms may only appear during specific weather patterns, and players must adapt their foraging strategies accordingly. A dynamic day-night cycle and seasonal changes add an extra layer of depth to the gameplay.
> **Community Building:** As players progress, they can establish a camp or village where fellow mushroom enthusiasts gather. Trading mushrooms, sharing insights, and collaborating on challenging quests contribute to the growth of the community.
> **Quests and Mysteries:** The game features a rich storyline with quests and mysteries tied to the magical properties of certain rare mushrooms. Unraveling these mysteries unlocks new areas, abilities, and advancements in the game.
> **Art Style:** The game adopts a vibrant and whimsical art style, with lush environments, colorful mushrooms, and magical effects. The atmosphere is both calming and mysterious, creating an immersive world that players will enjoy exploring.
